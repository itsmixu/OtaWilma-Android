# OtaWilma for Android
This project is up and running again, after a previous developer left their android implementation unfinished.

I am making this app from scratch, and maybe borrowing code from the original project.

This project will take a while, I have never made an android app so don't expect this to be done quickly.

## Current Status (Last updated  11/10):
I have built some basic UI so far, currently you can navigate through different screens and press on buttons. There is no "real functionality" to the app yet. Here are some screenshots:
